            When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it
            is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not
            to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life,
            have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life. Life can
            be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around
            you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter
            than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you
            learn that, you’ll never be the same again.
